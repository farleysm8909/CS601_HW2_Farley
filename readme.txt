WEEK 1

How I went above and beyond
  - Created 5 web pages instead of 3
  - Used 5-7 semantic elements on each page (each page contains a <header>, <nav>, <main> and <footer>, as well as additional tags like <section>, <figure>, <figcaption>, etc.)
  - Embeded 2 videos and over 10 images
  - Used elements such as &amp;, &copy;, &mdash;, <hr>
  - Wrote what I hope is considered interesting content pertaining to me (see About and Index) as opposed to Lorem Ipsum/filler text

Run the program
  Right click on index.html and select "open in default browser" or "open in other browsers" depending on which one you'd like to use. Coded in VS Code.


WEEK 2

How I went above and beyond
- imported and used a Google font for header
- 

Note: I did not format the resume iframe differently for the print version because the iframe provides an option to print the resume as a separate document (this makes more sense to me since the resume itself is exactly one page and it is a stand-alone item)
